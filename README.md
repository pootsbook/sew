Sew
===

Static, Elegant Websites; stitched together.

Description
-----------

Sew is a simple static site generator.

## Motivation

A rejection of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) for simpler sites.

## Inspiration

Inspired by @soveranâ€™s [Mote](https://github.com/soveran/mote), a simple and fast template engine.
